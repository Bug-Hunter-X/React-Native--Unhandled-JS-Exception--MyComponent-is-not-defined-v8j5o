# React Native Unhandled JS Exception: Component Not Defined

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: an unhandled JS exception caused by a missing component import.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Issue

The initial code attempts to render a functional component (`MyComponent`) without importing it, leading to a runtime error. 

## Solution

The solution involves simply importing the `MyComponent` component from the correct file.
