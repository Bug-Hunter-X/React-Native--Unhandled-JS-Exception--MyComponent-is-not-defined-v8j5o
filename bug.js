This React Native code snippet demonstrates a common error: using a functional component without the necessary import.  The code attempts to render a functional component named `MyComponent` but fails because it's not imported. 
```javascript
// Incorrect code
import React from 'react';

// ... other imports

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <MyComponent/>
    </View>
  );
};

// ... rest of the code
```
