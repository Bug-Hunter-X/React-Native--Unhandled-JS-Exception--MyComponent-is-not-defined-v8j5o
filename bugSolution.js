The corrected code demonstrates proper importing of a functional component. Note that the path to the `MyComponent` file might need to be adjusted according to your project structure.
```javascript
// Correct code
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent'; // Correct import statement

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <MyComponent/>
    </View>
  );
};

// ... rest of the code
```
